    <ol>
      <li>Spellcheck & No typos , good format, keyword coverage (in skills/tech section)</li>
      <li>Education, experience, projects most important</li>
      <li>Favor Concise & Brief descriptions. The resume will get maximum 30 seconds of attention before a decision. Make it so the recruiter gets the full big picture view of your skills in that 30 seconds, not the details. You will go into the details in the phone screen & interview.</li>
      <li>Customize your resume towards the job description (means you’ll have to edit you resume a lot for each job, this need tapers off after your 1st Jr Dev job, where you can solidify your resume around a stack you want to work on and only apply to jobs that fit that stack)</li>
      <li>Include a comprehensive list of skills and tech (for algo screens), but make it easy to read (not comma separated blob of text). Perhaps even scatter the keywords throughout the resume.</li>
      <li>Order of Emphasis: Code Work & Projects, then skills, Education last</li>
      <li>Easy to find links to example work/projects</li>
      <li>A customized cover letter for the job description (becomes less important after your first Jr. Dev job)</li>
    </ol>

      <li>Hiring managers are looking for someone who has already done/made something that is similar to their product</li>
      <ul>
        <li>So if you haven't built something similar to their product, then all bets are off. </li>
        <li>It's one of the fundamental principles of programming, that it's extremely difficult to gauge how much work is hidden behind the statement of a task</li>
        <li>The "trivial" and the "impossible" can look identical when merely sketched out as an idea in a kanban ticket</li>

    <h2>Job Search Tactics</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Communicate on multiple fronts - LinkedIn, Networking, <a href="https://rocdev.org/">RocDev Community</a></li>
      <li>Finish your Freecodecamp Certs and add them to your linkedin/resume</li>
      <li>Do your research on the Company - website, their blog, github, former/current employees</li>
      <li>Job market in Dev is strong, so you can afford to be a bit picky: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Apply to companies doing work you’re actually interested in since that passion you have for it will end up being a strength during your interview anyways</li>
        <li>However, getting your <strong>FIRST</strong> dev job will be hard, so you might have to settle for that one. Use your first job to level up for ~2 years and then try searching again for a better job match with better pay.</li>

    <h2>Common Interview Questions Types</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Background & Qualifications - 100% chance</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Prep & rehearse an outline</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Behavioral Questions - 75% chance</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Prep & rehearse your stories</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Whiteboarding & Technical Questions - 60% chance</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you think you missed a lot of the tech questions, then write theme down and use them to study to get better for the next time</li>
        <li>If you think you only missed one of two and (those might be the deciding factor in their decision) then get the interviewers email and when you get home figure out the right answer and send them the answer in your thank you follow up email in the next 24 hours. They may be impressed in your follow through.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Take home assignments - 40-50% chance</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Solutech Take home Example</li>
        </li><a href="https://wjv.io/portfolio/warcraft">EagleDream Mockup Example</a></li>
        <li>Pro-tip: Save a copy of the json response into an <code>example.json</code> file as a backup, so you can still show off the project even if they take down the API endpoint. Just fetch your example.json file instead.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

<article class="slide">
  <h2>Interview Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Strengths Question</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Find a github project of yours that matches their job description so you can speak about how you already have experience doing what they seek. If you don’t have a github project that matches yet, spend a week or two and make one before you apply.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Weakness Question</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Framing it as your learning goals. Mention a tutorial you are already taking to learn the thing in their job description that you lack right now.</li>
        <li title="Be honest with the fact that you are not a whole team, and won’t be able to do all functions on a team. One weakness may be you’re not as design savvy so would need to lean on a good designer in the team. Or one might be that you aren’t familiar with databases yet, so would need to work with a good backend developer for that. That’s fine, specialization is fine in this industry. Just talk about how any weakness you might have can be overcome with being a teamplayer and working collaboratively with others on the team.">
          Frame it as not a weakness but merely being specialized and you will have to lean on a team for other things like design or database knowledge for example.

      <li>When was the last time they promoted someone on the dev team and why?</li>
      <li>What’s the team like? How many devs on it? Who’s your boss?</li>
      <li>What’s the tech stack & codebase like? Test coverage? How old is the oldest bit of code in production?</li>
      <li>What is the budget or salary range for this position?</li>
      <li>What compelled you to work for this company? (depends on chemistry)</li>

    <h2>Time Estimation for Tickets</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Manager will try to negotiate time (you say it will take 4 weeks, they ask for 2 weeks)</li>
      <li>First hold your ground. The amount of effort it takes is static, the time criteria they are trying to push on because they are probably feeling pressure from CEO</li>
      <li>If theykeep pushing, then give them the time they are asking for and renegotiate the effort (i.e. how much stuff to fit into that time)</li>
      <li>Renegotiating the effort means redefining the scope (i.e. how much stuff to do for this cycle)</li>
      <li>Break down the tickets into smaller pieces and just fit in the first half of those tickets into the 2 weeks that they want</li>
      <li>For example, they want authentication (implicitly all the websites) in 2 weeks. Say you can do the authentication for the main dashboard site in 2 weeks. You’ll get to the old, barely visited website next cycle.</li>
