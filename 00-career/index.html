    <h2>Common Interview Questions Types</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Background & Qualificatins - 100% chance</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Prep & rehearse an outline</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Behavioral Questoins - 75% chance</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Prep & rehearse your stories</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Whiteboarding & Technical Questions - 60% chance</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you think you missed a lot of the tech questions, then write theme down and use them to study to get better for the next time</li>
        <li>If you think you only missed one of two and (those might be the deciding factor in their decision) then get the interviewers email and when you get home figure out the right answer and send them the answer in your thank you follow up email in the next 24 hours. They may be impressed in your follow through.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Take home assignments - 40-50% chance</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Solutech Take home Example</li>
        <li>EagleDream Mockup Example</li>
        <li>Pro-tip: Save a copy of the json response into an example.json file as a backup, so you can still show off the project even if they take down the API endpoint. Just fetch your example.json file instead.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Strengths Question</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Find a github project of yours that matches their job description so you can speak about how you already have experience doing what they seek. If you don‚Äôt have a github project that matches yet, spend a week or two and make one before you apply.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Weakness Question</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Framing it as your learning goals. Mention a tutorial you are already taking to learn the thing in their job description that you lack right now.</li>
        <li title="Be honest with the fact that you are not a whole team, and won‚Äôt be able to do all functions on a team. One weakness may be you‚Äôre not as design savvy so would need to lean on a good designer in the team. Or one might be that you aren‚Äôt familiar with databases yet, so would need to work with a good backend developer for that. That‚Äôs fine, specialization is fine in this industry. Just talk about how any weakness you might have can be overcome with being a teamplayer and working collaboratively with others on the team.">
          Frame it as not a weakness but merely being specialized and you will have to lean on a team for other things like design or database knowledge for example.

    <h2>Time Estimation for Tickets</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Manager will try to negotiate time (you say it will take 4 weeks, they ask for 2 weeks)</li>
      <li>First hold your ground. The amount of effort it takes is static, the time criteria they are trying to push on because they are probably feeling pressure from CEO</li>
      <li>If theykeep pushing, then give them the time they are asking for and renegotiate the effort (i.e. how much stuff to fit into that time)</li>
      <li>Renegotiating the effort means redefining the scope (i.e. how much stuff to do for this cycle)</li>
      <li>Break down the tickets into smaller pieces and just fit in the first half of those tickets into the 2 weeks that they want</li>
      <li>For example, they want authentication (implicitly all the websites) in 2 weeks. Say you can do the authentication for the main dashboard site in 2 weeks. You‚Äôll get to the old, barely visited website next cycle.</li>
