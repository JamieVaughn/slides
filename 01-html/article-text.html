Three Good Reasons for Doing User Research 

“Empathy is at the heart of design. Without the understanding of what others see, feel, and experience, design is a pointless task.” —Tim Brown, CEO of the innovation and design firm IDEO

“Empathy is at the heart of design. Without the understanding of what others see, feel, and experience, design is a pointless task.”The type of user research you should do depends on your work process as well as your reason for doing user research in the first place. Here are three excellent reasons for doing user research: 


To create designs that are truly relevant to your users 
To create designs that are easy and pleasurable to use 
To understand the return on investment (ROI) of your user experience (UX) design



The Take Away 
Here, we have shown three good reasons for doing user research and we have touched on when in your design process you can integrate user research. Here are the three reasons again: 
Do user research to ensure that you create products that are truly relevant to your target group. 
Do user research to ensure that your products deliver a great user experience.
Do user research to show the ROI of your design efforts.

Ideation is a creative process where designers generate ideas in sessions (e.g., brainstorming, worst possible idea). It is the third stage in the Design Thinking process. Participants gather with open minds to produce as many ideas as they can to address a problem statement in a facilitated, judgment-free environment. 
  
"It's not about coming up with the ‘right’ idea, it’s about generating the broadest range of possibilities.” - d.school, An Introduction to Design Thinking PROCESS GUIDE

At each stage of App UX Design there should be at least one Useability test. 


  

Many frontend developers start coding their app without doing any UX Research, or Useability Testing, or any user particiapting in the App useability. The UX component of making an App is at least 50% of the work involved in making a successful commericial App. In mid-size and large companies there are more designers being hired than engineers. Here is graphic showing the recent trend in increasing the design team.


The App  is not going to take over the world will not be very useful without user research or useabilty testing.
