  <h2>Three Good Reasons for Doing User Research</h2>

  <blockquote>“Empathy is at the heart of design. Without the understanding of what others see, feel, and experience,
    design is a pointless task.” —Tim Brown, CEO of the innovation and design firm IDEO </blockquote>

  <p>“Empathy is at the heart of design. Without the understanding of what others see, feel, and experience, design is a
    pointless task.”The type of user research you should do depends on your work process as well as your reason for
    doing user research in the first place. Here are three excellent reasons for doing user research: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>To create designs that are truly relevant to your users </li>
    <li>To create designs that are easy and pleasurable to use </li>
    <li>To understand the return on investment (ROI) of your user experience (UX) design</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>The Take Away</h2>
  <p>Here, we have shown three good reasons for doing user research and we have touched on when in your design process
    you can integrate user research. Here are the three reasons again: </p>
  Do user research to ensure that you create products that are truly relevant to your target group.
  Do user research to ensure that your products deliver a great user experience.
  Do user research to show the ROI of your design efforts.

  <p>Ideation is a creative process where designers generate ideas in sessions (e.g., <a
       href='https://google.com'>brainstorming<a />, worst possible idea). It is the third stage in the Design Thinking
      process. Participants gather with open minds to produce as many ideas as they can to address a problem statement
      in a facilitated, judgment-free environment.

      <blockquote>"It's not about coming up with the ‘right’ idea, it’s about generating the broadest range of
        possibilities.” - d.school, An Introduction to Design Thinking PROCESS GUIDE </blockquote>

      <p><i><strong>***Graphic Arts Majors with UX Training are in demand***</strong> In this article we make a case for
          a wide array of professionals learn some of the skills and concepts of UX. There are three simple areas of UX
          to illustrate the need for learning basic UX skill sets. For Graphic Artists UX Design is relative. If you are
          a marketing manager or brand manager then basic skill sets in UX Reserch and Digital Markeing are recommneded.
          If you are working with User Interfaces in areas such as new product devlopment (IoT, VR, AI, Apps, Web Sites)
          then User Expereience is driving the adoption of products and services (think Amazon, NetFlix, Google, Apple).

  <h2>At each stage of App UX Design there should be at least one Useability test. </h2>

  <br>
  <span>Many frontend developers start coding their app without doing any UX Research, or Useability Testing, or any
    user particiapting in the App useability. The UX component of making an App is at least 50% of the work involved in
    making a successful commericial App. In mid-size and large companies there are more designers being hired than
    engineers. Here is graphic showing the recent trend in increasing the design team.


    The App <strike> is not going to take over the world</strike> will not be very useful without user research or
    useabilty testing.</span>
