# Live demo

Enable by adding the `demo` class to your slide.

Modifiers:
- `minimal`: Disables additional styling.
- `isolated`: Renders the demo in an `<iframe>`, rather than directly in the slide.
- `horizontal`: Lays out the slide in a horizontal layout, with the code on the bottom and the rendering on the top.
